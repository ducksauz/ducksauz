## Ohai! ðŸ‘‹

If you're coming to [Teardown2024](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024) and are planning to take my workshop on [Making IoT Devices on ESP32 with Matter and Thread](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024/workshop/making-iot-devices-on-esp32-with-matter-and-thread), *PLEASE* install the needed tools and docker image before you come so you're not fighting with conference wifi on the day.

Check out the instructions in the workshop README. There's even a tl;dr version for those with limited attention spans.
