Hi. I'm ducksauz. Thanks for dropping by my github profile.

Perhaps you've seen me [on Mastodon](https://snug.town/@ducksauz), or perhaps you came to one of my workshops on [Making IoT Devices on ESP32 with Matter and Thread](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024/workshop/making-iot-devices-on-esp32-with-matter-and-thread).

If you're interested in that topic, I recommend you check out the [esp-matter-workshop](https://github.com/ducksauz/esp-matter-workshop) and [esp-matter-dev](https://github.com/ducksauz/esp-matter-dev) repos.

If you like a good joke, I suggest you check out [WelshOTP](https://github.com/ducksauz/welshOTP).
